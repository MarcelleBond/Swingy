# Swinggy Text-Based RPG Game

The Text-Based RPG Game is a Java-based game that simulates a text-based role-playing game. The game is designed to be played in two phases: the first phase is console-based, while the second phase will also have a simple GUI for taking user input.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a text-based role-playing game that can be played in both console and GUI modes. The project requires the implementation of the Model-View-Controller design pattern, automated build with Maven, and annotation-based user input validation. A good and clear implementation will be accepted, with a clean design that is easy to read and modify in case of changing requirements.

## Requirements

To successfully implement a winning solution, the program must meet the following key requirements:

- Respect the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- Implement automated build with Maven.
- Use annotation-based user input validation.
- Develop the program as a multi-module Maven build for easier maintenance and deployment.

## Usage

To use the program, first, make sure you have Java installed on your machine. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Use Maven to compile the program by running the following command in your terminal:

mvn clean install

Once the program has been compiled, navigate to the target directory and run the following command to start the game:

java -jar text-based-rpg.jar
